# VM_BuildUp
Use Vagrant to build and configure multiple VMs in VirtualBox.
* Run basic and VM-speicifc provisions ex - Docker installation
* Build VMs in the fast pace so I can tear them down and rebuild them quickly
* Use private network so the communication between the host and VMs under the same subnet
